# Text2SQL-Query-Bot
The goal of this project is to create a bot that harnesses the power of LLM's like Llama 2 to convert **natural language queries to SQL queries**. 
We aim to achieve state of the art scores against the latest benchmarks such as [Spider](https://yale-lily.github.io/spider) and [BIRD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.03111.pdf).
